# CoCoIRC
CoCoIRC is a native IRC chat client for the Tandy Color Computer 3 running under the NitrOS9 operating system. Currently, DriveWire Server running on an internet-connected computer is required for CoCoIRC to work. I may support other networking solutions in the future.<br><br>

It is, by no means, a complete IRC client but it supports all of the necessities and I do hope to continue to expand it's features and functions down the road. Feel free to try it out in a CoCo 3 emulator or on a real bare-metal machine if you have one. Hope you find it useful! Have fun :)
